# 🧑‍💻 Rootconf 2025 Workshop: **Detecting Supply Chain Attacks at Runtime with eBPF**

Welcome! In this workshop, you’ll learn how to detect **supply chain attacks** using **eBPF** — by tracing real runtime behaviors that static scanners miss.

No kernel or eBPF experience needed. Just follow along.

---

## ✅ What You'll Do

* Trace file access, network connections, and suspicious process behavior
* Simulate real-world supply chain exfiltration
* Integrate eBPF detection into CI pipelines (GitHub Actions)
* Customize detections to match attacker behaviors
* Add Slack alerts & fail builds on runtime threats

---

## 📝 Prerequisites

* Linux VM (Ubuntu 20.04 preferred)
* Python 3.8+, clang, bcc installed
* Docker installed (for CI integration)
* GitHub account

---

## 🏁 Step 1: Environment Setup (10 mins)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitcoder/rootconf25-training-lab.git
cd rootconf25-training-lab
```

> ✅ Ensure you have Docker, bcc, and clang installed.
> You can follow the [setup script from here](https://github.com/rohitcoder/rootconf-25-supplychain/blob/main/setup.sh).

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Detect Sensitive File Access (.env) (20 mins)

Run the tracer:

```bash
sudo python3 openat_tracer.py
```

In another terminal, simulate file access:

```bash
echo "SECRET=abc" > .env
cat .env
```

✅ You should see a log when `.env` is accessed.

🎯 **Goal:** Understand syscalls, tracepoints, and live observability.

---

## 🌐 Step 3: Detect Outbound Connections (20 mins)

Run outbound tracer:

```bash
sudo python3 connect_tracer.py
```

Trigger outbound connection:

```bash
curl https://google.com
```

✅ You'll see connection attempts being traced.

🎯 **Goal:** Catch suspicious outbound traffic in real-time.

---

## 🏴‍☠️ Step 4: Simulate Supply Chain Exfiltration (15 mins)

Run attack simulation:

```bash
bash simulate_exfil.sh
```

✅ Your tracers will detect secret access + exfil attempt.

🎯 **Goal:** Visualize supply chain attack flow.

---

## 🗡️ Step 5: Detect Suspicious Binary Execution (/tmp backdoors) (15 mins)

Run execve tracer:

```bash
sudo python3 execve_tracer.py
```

Test suspicious exec:

```bash
cp /bin/ls /tmp/ls
/tmp/ls
```

✅ You'll get alerts for binaries running from `/tmp`.

🎯 **Goal:** Understand process execution tracing for malware detection.

---

## 🤖 Step 6: CI Integration with eBPF Detection (30 mins)

We’ll now run a **GitHub Actions pipeline** that:

* Starts a detector container (built from [rootconf-25-supplychain](https://github.com/rohitcoder/rootconf-25-supplychain))
* Simulates exfil attack
* Detects runtime behavior using eBPF
* Prints logs, fails build (optional)

To trigger:

```bash
# Make a dummy commit to run the workflow
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI"
git push
```


✅ Workflow will run `.github/workflows/hello-world.yml` and show detections.

🎯 **Goal:** See runtime detection working inside CI pipelines.

---

## 🛠️ Step 7: Hack Time — Customize Detections (30 mins)

Now you will extend the detectors.

### Challenges:

* [ ] Modify `hello-world.yml` to send a Slack alert when detection happens.
* [ ] Filter outbound connections to ignore github.com IPs.
* [ ] Add `.pem` and `.aws` files to sensitive file detection.
* [ ] Detect if a binary from `/tmp` spawns `curl` (process chain).
* [ ] Bonus: Modify `supplychain-detect.py` and build your own Docker image.

Hints:

* Detector code → [supplychain-detect.py](https://github.com/rohitcoder/rootconf-25-supplychain/blob/main/supplychain-detect.py)
* Rebuild Docker image if you customize detections.

🎯 **Goal:** Adapt detectors to real attacker behaviors.

## 🔄 Step 8: How This Extends to Jenkins / GitLab / Azure (10 mins)

We’ll discuss:

* Using eBPF detectors in self-hosted runners
* Sidecar pattern for supply chain detection
* Minimal changes to reuse across CI/CD systems
